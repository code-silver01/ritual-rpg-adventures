**Our Approach:**
- We chose this problem because building habits is **one of the most transformative skills** — but most apps are boring.
- We wanted to inject *fun*, *emotion*, and *social accountability* into productivity.
- Major brainstorms:
  - Switching from "task checklist" → "fantasy quest adventure"
  - Building **guild mechanics** for social motivation
  - Introducing **adaptive real-world rewards** after streaks
- Pivots:
  - Originally solo-play only → added Guild system
  - Added Dashboard visualization for deeper habit tracking

🏁 Final Words
This hackathon was an incredible experience —  
We learned to **pivot quickly**, **think emotionally for users**, and **mix fun with function**.  
Biggest fun moment: designing ridiculous fantasy names for real habits (like *"Summon the Spirit of Consistency"* instead of "Morning Run").  
Thanks to the organizers for this magical opportunity! 🎉
